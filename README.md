## Use
Currently, to access new files the filename must be changed directly from within the code at line 6. The player can then be run by loading dfcmv.html in your modern web browser of choice. A live example is available at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15574345/dfcmv-js/dfcmv.html.
##To-Do
* Implement checks to consolidate operation into a single canvas using the better context in each case.
* Implement control features (play, pause, frame control etc).
* Clean up old javascript.
* UI, progress bars.
* Induct shader code into javascript to allow for player insertion on other websites without cross origin request concerns.
* Compact player into a single object to allow for easier initialisation.
